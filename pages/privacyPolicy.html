      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h2>Last updated-December 2019</h2>

      <p>At OrgLens Consultancy Pvt. Ltd. ("OrgLens", "We", "Our", or "Us"), we are committed to respect and protect the privacy of the users ("You" or "Your"). This Privacy Policy ("Policy") is intended to memorialize our data collection and disclosure practices for our platform, solutions, website and service offerings (collectively, the "Services").</p>
    <p>The Services offered by OrgLens are fundamentally a means for Enterprises to understand and optimize the Social Network of its Employees to drive Engagement, Inclusivity and Collaboration.</p>
    <p>OrgLens reserves the right to change this Policy at any time. In particular, OrgLens may modify this Policy to reflect changes in the way we collect, use, or disclose information, or to reflect changes in privacy laws, regulations, and/or industry standards. We encourage Our Users to review this Policy when accessing the Services. Continued use of the Services following changes indicates acceptance of the changes.</p>
    
    <h3>CONSENT</h3>
    <p>By registering or using OrgLens, you consent to this Policy. If you do not accept the terms of this Policy, your only remedy is to discontinue use of the Services or write to us if you have any specific issues with respect to this Policy. Information gathered through the Services may be transferred, used, and stored in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions in which OrgLens, our agents, customers, and other users of the Services are located. If you access the Services, you consent to the transfer, use, and storage of your information in those jurisdictions.</p>
    
    <h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <p>The personal information that we may collect about you through the Services broadly falls into the following categories:</p>
   
  
  <h4>Information that you provide voluntarily</h4>
  <p>Certain parts of our platform or while using our services including the website, we may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily: for example, we may ask you to provide your contact details in order to request a demo, register an account with us, to subscribe to marketing communications from us, and/or to submit inquiries to us. Typically, we will ask for your name and contact details, and some basic information about the company you work for, the products you are interested in, and your role in the company. The Personal Data collected may include, but is not necessarily limited to name, user name, address, email address, phone number, IP address, biometrics which may include face capture and voice fingerprints and figure, use and browser information, knowledge, skills, abilities, resume data, and answers to employment, assessment-related questions (which may be captured via audio, video, and text).</p>
  
  <h4>Information that we collect automatically</h4>
  <p>When you visit our Website or use our platform, we may collect certain information automatically from your device using cookies and similar tracking technology. In some countries, this information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws.</p>
  
 <p>Specifically, the information we collect automatically may include information like your IP address, device type, unique device identification numbers, browser-type, broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location), and other technical information. We may also collect information about how your device has interacted with our Website or Platform, including the pages accessed and links clicked.</p>

<p>Collecting this information enables us to better understand the visitors who come to our Website or Platform, where they come from, and what content on our Website or Platform is of interest to them. We use this information for our internal analytics purposes and to improve the quality and relevance of our Website or platform to our visitors.</p>


<h3>NON PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>Non-Personal Information ("NPI") is the information we collect through this website or Platform that does not identify you by name or as an individual person. It may include information like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The type of web browser software your computer uses</li>
  <li>Pages your computer visited and date and time your computer accessed our pages</li>
  <li>Personal information that has been de-identified, and</li>
  <li>The IP (Internet Protocol) address associated with your computer</li>
</ul>

<p>We use NPI in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve Our Users, to customize the Services and to improve the content and functionality of the Services. We also conduct research on Our User demographics and behaviour based on Personal Information and the NPI that we have collected. This research will be compiled and analysed on an aggregate basis and this aggregate does not identify any individual and therefore is considered and treated as NPI under this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We use third-party tools which use cookies to track NPI about traffic and visitors to Our Services in the aggregate to compile statistical reports about the activity on the Services as well as to benchmark the Services. This information is used by us to improve the Services and their functionality.</p>

<h3>USE OF INFORMATION</h3>
<p>We use your information to provide the services you have requested to create and maintain your accounts and keep a check for unauthorized activity on your accounts. We also use it to communicate with you about the products you are currently using, your customer support requests, new products you may like, chances for you to give us feedback, and policy updates. We analyze the information we collect to understand user needs and to improve our websites and services. We limit access to your personal information to our employees and contractors who have a legitimate need to use it.</p>
<p>OrgLens collects information about employees and their survey responses to help Enterprises assess levels of engagement, collaboration, inclusion and other key elements related to employee / contractor communities.</p>
<p>We collect Personal Information of the person authorized by the Enterprises. This information is collected to facilitate OrgLens' platform or services to such persons. In general, OrgLens collects such User information to provide the following services:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create and administer accounts;</li>
  <li>Provide access to the Users;</li>
  <li>Record keeping;</li>
  <li>Improving products and services;</li>
  <li>Meeting legal and regulatory requirements;</li>

  <li>Understanding and analyzing our users' needs and preferences;</li>
  <li>Sending information that OrgLens believes a User may find helpful;</li>
  <li>Develop new products, services, features and functionality;</li>
  <li>Preventing any kind of cyber-crimes or fraudulent activities;</li>
  <li>Provide, operate and maintain Our Website, Platform and Services.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can decline certain kinds of information use either by not providing the information in the first place or by opting out later. You can also disable cookies to prevent your browser from giving us information, but if you do so, certain website features may not work properly.</p>
<p>We keep your Personal Information for as long as it is required for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. When we no longer have a legitimate need to process your information, we will delete, anonymize, or isolate your information, whichever is appropriate.</p>

<h3>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h3>
<p>Unless otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy, OrgLens will not share your Personal Information with third parties. We do not sell your Personal Information to third parties.</p>

<h3>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h3>
<p>Content, trademark, logo, domain name, User Interface, look & feel of the Website and Services (collectively called as Intellectual Property) are solely owned by us. No such Intellectual Property shall be used, copied, reproduced, distributed, transmitted, broadcast, displayed, sold, licensed or otherwise exploited for any other purposes whatsoever without our prior written consent.</p>

<h3>LOG FILES</h3>
<p>OrgLens follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors and users when they visit websites and use our applications. All hosting companies do this as a part of hosting services analytics. The information collected by log files includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring / exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is for analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movement on the website and usage of applications and gathering demographic information.</p>


<h3>COOKIES</h3>
<p>From time to time, OrgLens may also use "cookies", "web beacons" or similar technology for the convenience of Users and to enhance Users experience using the Services. A cookie is a small text file that is recorded either temporarily or persistently on a hard drive by a web page server and is not used to deliver viruses or other harmful programs to computers. Rather, cookies enable OrgLens to recognize a User without requiring the User to repeatedly log in when using the Services. Web beacons are graphics designed to collect web log information such as pages viewed or messages opened. By relying on cookies, web beacons, and similar technology, OrgLens may be able to deliver a more efficient service that is more personalized for each user. Additionally, these technologies may allow OrgLens to monitor traffic patterns, Services usage, and session information to make the Services more useful.</p>

<h3>TESTIMONIALS</h3>
<p>We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our website in addition to other endorsements. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at info@orglens.com.</p>

<h3>NEWSLETTERS</h3>
<p>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or you can contact us at info@orglens.com.</p>

<h3>DATA INTEGRITY AND SECURITY</h3>
<p>OrgLens maintains reasonable and appropriate security measures to maintain the accuracy and integrity of Personal Information. OrgLens has implemented physical and technical safeguards to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alternation, or destruction.</p>
<p>We restrict access to your Personal Data to those employees of ours, our affiliates, and third-party service providers who reasonably need it to provide products or services. We have implemented commercially reasonable electronic, physical and procedural safeguards designed to help protect against the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction of the information under our control. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>Certain features of our Website or Platform may require you to use an access code, password or similar unique identifier. You are responsible for protecting the secrecy of your account information. OrgLens recommends that you use the latest browsers so as to take advantage of advances in security technology. Although we strive to protect your encrypted information, no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure. There is some risk associated with any data transmission, including the risk that personal information may be intercepted in transit. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at info@orglens.com.</p>

<h3>DATA RETENTION</h3>
<p>We retain your personal information for as long as it is required for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. Sometimes, we may retain your information for longer periods as permitted or required by law, such as to maintain suppression lists, prevent abuse, if required in connection with a legal claim or proceeding, to enforce our agreements, for tax, accounting, or to comply with other legal obligations. When we no longer have a legitimate need to process your information, we will delete or anonymize your information from our active databases. We will also securely store the information and isolate it from further processing on backup discs until deletion is possible.</p>

<h3>COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<p>We make every effort, including periodic reviews, to ensure that Personal Information you provide is used in conformity with this Privacy Policy. If you have any concerns about our adherence to this Privacy Policy or the manner in which your personal information is used, kindly write to us info@orglens.com. We will contact you, and if required, coordinate with the appropriate regulatory authorities to effectively address your concerns.</p>

<h3>NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES</h3>
<p>We may modify the Privacy Policy at any time, upon notifying you through a service announcement or by sending an email to your primary email address. If we make significant changes to the Privacy Policy that affect your rights, you will be provided with at least 30 days' advance notice of the changes by email to your primary email address. If you think that the updated Privacy Policy affects your rights with respect to your use of our products or services, you may terminate your use by sending us an email within 30 days. Your continued use after the effective date of changes to the Privacy Policy will be deemed to be your agreement to the modified Privacy Policy. You will not receive email notification of minor changes to the Privacy Policy. If you are concerned about how your personal information is used, you should check back at https://orglens.com/privacy-policy.html periodically.</p>
